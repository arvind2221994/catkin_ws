* Invert Assimp version detect logic for greater accuracy
* Updated Assimp defines to be more flexible
  This commit is a follow-up to 85b20197671e142044e471df603debd0faf08baf
  Why was export.h removed from assimp < 3.0.0?
* Better feature detection for assimp version
  The unified headers were introduced in Assimp 2.0.1150, so checking for Assimp 3.0.0 is not quite the best solution.
